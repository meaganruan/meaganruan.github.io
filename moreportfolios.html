            the project I created for my capstone class at Brooklyn College.
            This is a project that I initiated but did not contribute to during
            my first semester at CUNY Tech Prep (CTP), a year-long program that
            helps students learn and develop in-demand technical skills.
            <br />
            <p>
              It was personally difficult to find things to do with friends
              and/or family that did not involve drinking or clubbing between
              the awkward age range of 18-21. There are other apps that show
              users events like the one I am building, however, this project is
              directed to help make it more accessible for users that are not
              interested in 18+ events or events solely in major cities like New
              York or Miami. I am using HTML, CSS, and React.js for the front
              end and Node.js, Express.js and PostgreSQL for the backend. I
              created mockups in Figma before starting to implement it.

            is a project created during the first ever hackathon hosted by CUNY
            Brooklyn College <i>(Hack Brooklyn).</i>
            <br />
            <p>
              As a team of 3, we implemented a Java program that generated
              either a compliment, advice, or a motivational quote depending on
              what the user wanted to generate. Individually, I created the
              simple graphical user interface (GUI) which consisted of buttons
              and a text field for output. This was my first ever hackathon that
              was hosted virtually because of the COVID-19 situation.

            was a project from my time during the
            <i>Break Through Tech (formerly WiTNY) </i>2020 Winternship at
            Google.

            <br />
            <p>
              During the winternship, I was put in a group of 2 to work on a
              database from Kaggle called Bus Lines in NYC. We conducted data
              analyses based on data sets and applied machine learning for
              predictions using Python. This was our first time learning and
              implementing Python in Google Collaboratory. We had also created
              visualization for bus routes and predicted buses based on the bus
              arrival and accuracy using matplotlib, seaborn, and geopandas.

                When I see myself, I see my imperfections and I wanted to
                overcome my lack of confidence. I made sure that I shown my
                pores and blackheads, my uneven eyebrows and almond eyes. I was
                inspired by Frida Kahlo because she would not be considered as
                the typical beauty standards nowadays. It inspired me knowing
                that one’s imperfections shouldn’t matter to others.

                I consider myself a techie as well as a down-to-Earth person. I
                believe these two items represent who I am- a phone as well as
                my favorite hobby, yarn knitting. I have added a yellow gradiant
                hexagon in the back to combine the two items together.

              <p>
                I wanted to have fun and create something weird. I have decided
                to merge a woman and a starfish. The image is inspired by the
                pink starfish in the Pixar animation called “Finding Nemo”.

                Haikus were originally supposed to be about nature; so I decided
                to follow that tradition. My haiku is about warm weather
                transitioning to colder weather.

            <div class="sub-sections poetry">
              <p>
                The picture is based on a song called “Tango” by Abir. The empty
                space is where the woman’s partner is supposed to be. However, I
                have replaced the partner with the lyrics of “Tango”. The song
                is all about being independent- not needing to rely on someone
                else.

              This is a 3 set part of my Digital Art class's final project. I
              took this class in Fall 2020 during the COVID-19 Pandemic. I
              decided to work my project around the health triangle, which
              consists of 3 elements- physical, mental, and social health since
              it was super important for me during the pandemic.
            </p>

            <h4>Physical Triangle</h4>
            <div class="sub-sections">
              <div class="physical-triangle">
                <img
                  class="triangles"
                  src="pics/physical-triangle.png"
                  alt="physical health triangle"
                />
                <p>
                  For the physical part I have decided to create an apartment
                  complex since we live in the city. Many people have done
                  amazing things just by being at home.
                  <br />
                  For the top half of the building, I have decided to create
                  windows showcasing a bookshelf, a cat, and a kitchen. The
                  bookshelf represented how many people have been reading more
                  about the pandemic and even reading as a hobby. The cat is a
                  representation of how families can give their pets more care
                  and attention now that they are home with them. If a person
                  was living alone, they would have a pet to keep them company
                  during isolation. The last window of the top half of the
                  building is the kitchen. Many people have been cooking food
                  and baking sweets at home which can be more healthy than
                  ordering take-out.
                  <br />
                  In the bottom half of the apartment building, we have a window
                  showcasing an office room. In quarantine, many people have
                  lost their jobs, however, the ones who have kept their jobs,
                  may have been working at home virtually. The next window has a
                  workoutroom with a treadmill because many people have also
                  been work- ing out more to stay productive and in shape while
                  at home. The last window has an easel with an empty canvas and
                  some paint. I think people have been more artistically
                  inclined since the beginning of the pandemic. I personally
                  have tried to focus more on myself by making collages and
                  designing websites.

                  When I created this journal page, I was listening to this song
                  called “Skeletons” by Keshi. I was listening to the lyrics and
                  it resonated with me about how I was feeling during
                  quarantine. I have decided to make a chamomile flower because
                  chamomile tea is well known for calming nerves. I wanted to
                  combine the lyrics and these chamomile flowers into the
                  journal page. The words in the song are scrambled around the
                  page because that is how I think the situation and my
                  emotional states were- very jumbled and messy.

                  Many people like myself have been on the internet a lot more
                  because of online work and online school. This is a fake chat
                  app interface on the screen and it represents how people
                  communicate nowadays. People chat through video calls now more
                  than they did pre-quarantine. I genuinely disliked some
                  features and the user experience of the popular video-calling
                  program- Zoom. So I decided to create my own fake app mockup.
