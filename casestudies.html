          Efflorescence is a flower catalogue app designed to help users decide what flowers and bouquets would best suit their wants and needs.
          Our flower catalogue will let users discover and purchase flowers for pickup which will affect customers who need flowers for certain occasions by organizing and recommending flowers by occasions. We will measure effectiveness by tracking indecisive customers who need flowers.

            <p>
              For James Marley, the flower catalogue app can allow him to search for bouquets and flowers that may best suit his date. 
              He will also be able to purchase the flowers in advance so that he can pick it up without rushing.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              For Rose Owens, having a catalogue may not necessarily help her but being able to sort the bouquets and flowers like in James Marley's case may help.
              She will be able to search for the low-cost options as well as include a discount code if needed.

          <p>From paper wireframes to digital wireframes. I first designed 5 pages for the app.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Home Page:</h4>
            <p>
              I decided to create a navigation bar on the bottom to accommodate iPhone users since they no longer have built-in navigation buttons.
              The welcoming introduction allows users to identify if they are logged in or on the correct account.
              The featured slideshow allows the users to view popular and trending flowers/ bouquets.
            </p>
            <h4>Discover Page:</h4>
            <p>
              I left this page with only images of flowers and bouquets so users could have an idea or spark some inspiration. I also added a sort button to allow the users to specify what they are looking for.
            </p>
            <h4>Browse Page:</h4>
            <p>
              I decided to add the quiz banner here for in case they wanted to have a fun time taking one and may introduce them to flowers that they may be interested in.
              At the top, users will also be able to search for a specific item if they know what they would like.
            </p>

        <h2 id="Conclusion1"><u>Conclusion</u></h2>
        <h3>Takeaways: </h3>
        <p>
          Users have said that the app is clear and easy to navigate. It also has a simple and clean design to it. 
          I learned that it's best to keep the colors minimal to avoid distractions. I also learned that there should be multiple methods in navigating to different screens. This will help with the user's experience.
        </p>
        <h3>Next Steps: </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>I would like to change the visual design of this app to make it more appealing.</li>
          <li>I would also like to create more animations to make the app more accessible and pleasing for the user's experience.</li>
          <li>I would conduct more user research and focus more on solving the persona's problems.</li>
        </ul>
